## Troubleshooting

### Why am I seeing a black image?

Common causes and solutions:

1. Adjust brightness: modify the brightness settings.
2. Conversion issue: image conversion may have failed  
   *(rare — contact the site administrator if you suspect this)*.
3. Network/connection issue: close the viewer window and reopen the dataset.
