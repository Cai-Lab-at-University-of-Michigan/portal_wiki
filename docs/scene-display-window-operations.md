## Basic Operations

1. **ROI Selection**  
   Hold `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+B` (macOS), then drag your mouse to select a region of interest (ROI).

2. **Download or Annotate ROI**  
   After selecting an ROI, click `ROI Selection` or press `Ctrl+D` / `Cmd+D`.  
   Then choose the layer and resolution you want to download or annotate.

3. **Share the Scene**  
   Click `Share` icon, then copy the generated link and share it with collaborators.

4. **Save the Scene**  
   To save the current scene (view, layers, settings), press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (macOS) in the viewer window.  
   This saves your current visualization state for later reuse or sharing.
