## Basic Image Adjustments

1. Open an image or scene and click `Shader Editor`.  
   This panel controls visualization settings in the Neuroglancer viewer.
2. Adjust the visualization layout as needed.  
   You may also enable **3D volume rendering** — use the gain slider to refine the rendering.
3. Select an image layer to make layer-specific adjustments, such as:
   - Brightness
   - Contrast
   - Channel color
4. Experiment with these controls to optimize viewing for your dataset and annotation workflow.
5. To save the current visualization settings, press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (macOS) in the Scene Display Window.
