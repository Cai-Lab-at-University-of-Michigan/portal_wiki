   - **Right panel** — server collection (upload destination)
   - **Important**: Upload files only to the **root folder** of the destination.
5. In the left panel, select your desktop collection and navigate to the desired files.
6. Drag files from the left panel to the right panel  
   *or* click `Transfer or Sync to ...` to start the transfer.
